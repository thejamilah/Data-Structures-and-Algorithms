#### Linked List Summary</br>
In Linked Lists we are looking further into data structures. Space and Time (Big O) are money and when creating the architecture of our code we are always looking in to the allocation of memory. Using nodes allows dynamic memory use. NOTE: I didn't say memory allocation. We touched on memory allocation in regards to static data structure. The use of linked lists give way to dynamic in a way that you can redistribute memory allocation by revising the use of nodes instead of allocating more space for example with an array.
Fun fact (or maybe not so fun)
Above I mentioned how dynamic Linked Lists are with all the Node goodnessâ€¦well some further reading lead me to find that you can't use binary search with Linked Lists in as efficient manner as arrays.
Another fun fact because Linked Lists are dynamic unlike arrays it's not very cache friendly.
 

### Big O - What to Know</br>
* Time Complexity:
Worst case with insertion/deletion of a node O (1)
* Space Complexity: 
Worst case O (n)
