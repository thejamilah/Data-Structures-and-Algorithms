#### Binary Tree Search Summary</br>
Binary Search Trees; BSTs for short
There are all sorts of trees. For example: Binary Search Tree (what we are implementing in this data structure assignment), Binary Space Partition (Hello Gamers!), Binary Tries, Hash Trees, Heaps (Hello AI and robotics fans!), Huffman Coding Tree (What's up .jpeg), GGM Tree, Syntax Tree, Treap (Wireless Networking), T-tre
What's helpful about Binary Tree/Binary Tree Search is the storing and retrieving of information with the ability to insert, delete, and search faster than you would in a Lined List scenario.
