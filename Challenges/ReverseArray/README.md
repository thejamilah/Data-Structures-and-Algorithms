# Reverse an Array

## Directions
Write a method that reverses an array without using any built-in methods.

## Problem Domain
Write a method called ReverseArray() which takes in and array as an argument and returns/prints the array in reverse order. 

## Approach and Efficiency 
* Approach 1
#### Big O Time:</br>
O (n) The array is iteretated n times totalling the full lenghth of the array
#### Big O Space:</br>
O (n) A new array is instantiated to hold the elements of the reversed array

* Approach 2 - This approach reverses the array in place
#### Big O Time:</br>
O (log n) Time is Logarithmic by narrowing the serch by repeatedly dividing the data set in half to locate the target value instead of Linear performance of iterating through an array of unknown size that becomes less efficient depending upon the lenght of the inout size.</br>
#### Big O Space:</br>
O (1) Space complexity is constant and does not increase with the execution of the code block</br>
